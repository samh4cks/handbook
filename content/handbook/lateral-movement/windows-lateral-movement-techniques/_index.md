Windows lateral movement is the set of techniques attackers use to move from one compromised host to other machines in a Windows environment, typically by abusing credentials, services, or built-in admin tooling; here’s the thing — attackers often leverage stolen or reused accounts, impersonation tokens, remote management protocols (RDP, SMB, WinRM), and service misconfigurations to hop between systems without needing direct physical access. Successful lateral movement chains together footholds, credential access, and privilege elevation while taking advantage of weak segmentation, overly broad service accounts, and missing multifactor controls; defenders should focus on reducing credential exposure (unique, rotated credentials and managed service accounts), enforcing least privilege, segmenting networks, enabling strong authentication, and instrumenting detection around abnormal logons, unusual remote service use, and privileged token or replication activity to catch movement early.
