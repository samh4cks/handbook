**Network enumeration** is a systematic process used in penetration testing to actively probe and gather detailed information 
about a target network. Unlike passive reconnaissance, enumeration involves establishing direct communication with systems, 
exposing hosts, services, users, shares, and possible vulnerabilities. The insights gained are crucial for planning further attacks 
or security improvements.

Why Is Network Enumeration Important?

• Identifies Active Systems: Reveals live hosts and network devices for potential targeting.

• Discovers Attack Vectors: Exposes services, shares, and misconfigurations.

• Maps the Network: Helps understand the network’s structure, roles of systems, and potential choke points.

• Facilitates Vulnerability Assessment: Lays the groundwork for targeted vulnerability scanning and exploitation.

NMAP

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful, open-source security tool used extensively in the information gathering and enumeration 
phases of penetration testing. It enables testers to discover hosts, services, open ports, and system details across networks, making 
it a cornerstone of network reconnaissance
