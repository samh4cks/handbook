**Service enumeration** is the active process of probing open ports to identify the specific services running and extract detailed information from them. This includes service versions, configurations, users, shares, and any accessible data. It’s a critical step that helps reveal vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that simple scanning can’t. Service enumeration usually follows port scanning and guides the next phase of exploitation.
