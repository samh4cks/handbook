The [Domain Name System](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) (`DNS`) translates domain names (e.g., hackthebox.com) to the numerical IP addresses (e.g., 104.17.42.72). DNS is mostly `UDP/53`, but DNS will rely on `TCP/53` more heavily as time progresses. DNS has always been designed to use both UDP and TCP port 53 from the start, with UDP being the default, and falls back to using TCP when it cannot communicate on UDP, typically when the packet size is too large to push through in a single UDP packet.

### Enumeration

```bash
nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC <ip-address>
```

### DNS Zone Transfer

#### DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer

```bash
dig AXFR @ns1.inlanefreight.htb inlanefreight.htb
```

Tools like [Fierce](https://github.com/mschwager/fierce) can also be used to enumerate all DNS servers of the root domain and scan for a DNS zone transfer:

```bash
fierce --domain zonetransfer.me

NS: nsztm2.digi.ninja. nsztm1.digi.ninja.
SOA: nsztm1.digi.ninja. (81.4.108.41)

### Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration

`Domain takeover` is registering a non-existent domain name to gain control over another domain. If attackers find an expired domain, they can claim that domain to perform further attacks such as hosting malicious content on a website or sending a phishing email leveraging the claimed domain.

Domain takeover is also possible with subdomains called `subdomain takeover`. 

#### Subdomain Enumeration

##### Subfinder

```bash
./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       
                                                                       
        _     __ _         _                                           
____  _| |__ / _(_)_ _  __| |___ _ _

/__/\_,_|_.__/_| |_|_||_\__,_\___|_| v2.4.5

##### Subbrute

An excellent alternative is a tool called [Subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute). This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
cd subbrute
echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
./subbrute.py inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

Warning: Fewer than 16 resolvers per process, consider adding more nameservers to resolvers.txt.
inlanefreight.com
ns2.inlanefreight.com
www.inlanefreight.com
ms1.inlanefreight.com
support.inlanefreight.com

<SNIP>
```

The [can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz) repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.

### DNS Spoofing

DNS spoofing is also referred to as `DNS Cache Poisoning`. This attack involves altering legitimate DNS records with false information so that they can be used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent website. Example attack paths for the DNS Cache Poisoning are as follows:

* An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate 	one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (`MITM`) attack.

* Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by an attacker to modify the DNS records.

#### Local DNS Cache Poisoning

From a local network perspective, an attacker can also perform DNS Cache Poisoning using MITM tools like [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) or [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/).

```bash
cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

inlanefreight.com      A   192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com    A   192.168.225.110
```

Next, start the `Ettercap` tool and scan for live hosts within the network by navigating to `Hosts > Scan for Hosts`. Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., `192.168.152.129`) to Target1 and add a default gateway IP (e.g., `192.168.152.2`) to Target2.

![](target.webp)

Activate `dns_spoof` attack by navigating to `Plugins > Manage Plugins`. This sends the target machine with fake DNS responses that will resolve `inlanefreight.com` to IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![](etter_plug.webp)

After a successful DNS spoof attack, if a victim user coming from the target machine `192.168.152.129` visits the `inlanefreight.com` domain on a web browser, they will be redirected to a Fake page that is hosted on IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![](etter_site.webp)

In addition, a ping coming from the target IP address `192.168.152.129` to `inlanefreight.com` should be resolved to `192.168.225.110` as well:

```bash
C:\>ping inlanefreight.com
