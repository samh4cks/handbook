**Exploitation** is the phase where vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance and scanning are actively used to gain access to the target system. The goal here is to deliver a working payload and establish a shell or session on the target. This stage involves selecting the right exploit, customizing payloads, and executing them to break through security controls. A successful exploitation step provides the foothold needed to move into post-exploitation, where deeper access and persistence can be established.
