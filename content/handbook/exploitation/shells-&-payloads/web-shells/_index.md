A `web shell` is a browser-based shell session we can use to interact with the underlying operating system of a web server. Again, to gain remote code execution via web shell, we must first find a website or web application vulnerability that can give us file upload capabilities. Most web shells are gained by uploading a payload written in a web language on the target server. The payload(s) we upload should give us remote code execution capability within the browser. 

#### Laudanum, One Webshell to Rule Them All

[Laudanum](https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/tree/master/laudanum) is a repository of ready-made files that can be used to inject onto a victim and receive back access via a reverse shell, run commands on the victim host right from the browser, and more. The repo includes injectable files for many different web application languages to include asp, aspx, jsp, php, and more. This is a staple to have on any pentest.

#### Antak WebShell

Antak is a web shell built in ASP.Net included within the [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) project. Nishang is an Offensive PowerShell toolset that can provide options for any portion of your pentest. Since we are focused on web applications for the moment, let's keep our eyes on Antak. Antak utilizes PowerShell to interact with the host, making it great for acquiring a web shell on a Windows server. 

#### PHP Web Shells

We will be using [WhiteWinterWolf's PHP Web Shell](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell). We can download this or copy and paste the source code into a .php file.
