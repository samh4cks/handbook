Password attacks focus on breaking or bypassing authentication to gain access to systems, services, or data. They can range from brute-forcing and wordlist-based cracking with tools like John or Hashcat, to more targeted methods like credential stuffing, spraying default logins, or extracting hashes from compromised machines and reusing them for lateral movement. In practice, password attacks sit at the heart of both exploitation (initial access) and post-exploitation (credential harvesting and reuse).
