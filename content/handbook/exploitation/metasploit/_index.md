**Metasploit Framework** is one of the most widely used tools for exploitation. It provides a large collection of ready-made exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules that allow security testers to simulate real-world attacks. With Metasploit, you can deliver payloads, gain shells, and automate common exploitation tasks, making it a central tool during the exploitation phase of penetration testing.
