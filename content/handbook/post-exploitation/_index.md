Post-exploitation is what happens after an attacker gets a foothold: they consolidate access, hunt for credentials and high-value systems, move laterally, establish persistence, and collect or stage data for exfiltration — all while trying to stay covert. The critical defender priorities are the inverse: detect anomalous logins and admin-protocol use, isolate affected hosts to stop spread, preserve forensic evidence, rotate or revoke compromised credentials in a controlled manner, and remove persistence before restoring services. What this really means is focusing on fast containment plus careful cleanup and root-cause fixes (patches, least-privilege, hardened endpoints, and improved telemetry) so attackers can’t repeat the chain that let them in.
