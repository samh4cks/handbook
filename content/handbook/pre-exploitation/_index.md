**Pre-exploitation** is the phase where you gather and analyze information about the target before attempting any kind of exploit. It includes scanning ports, fingerprinting services, discovering subdomains, mapping directories, and identifying potential vulnerabilities. The focus is on understanding the attack surface and collecting enough context to make exploitation efficient, stealthy, and effective. This groundwork reduces noise, avoids guesswork, and increases the chances of a successful breach.
