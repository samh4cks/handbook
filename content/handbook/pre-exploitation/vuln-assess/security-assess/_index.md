A **Vulnerability Assessment** aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

The purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk.
