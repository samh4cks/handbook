# Introduction

##### Hey there 👋

If you’ve ended up here, you probably got the link from me, or maybe Google’s being nosy. Either way, this is my personal prep space — notes, commands, and random thoughts I’ve collected while working through the labs.

Things are still shifting around, and a bunch of sections are unfinished. If something looks half-baked, it probably is. I’m building this as I go.

Feel free to poke around.
